# Springboard-Foundations-Data-Wrangling-Exercise-2
March 2017

This is my second data wrangling exercise for Springboard's Foundations of Data Science course in March 2017. In this project, I used the Titanic dataset and filled in missing values in several variables.

In this code, I used the packages tidyr, readxl, and dplyr.
